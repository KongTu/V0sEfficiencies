Macros to calculate the V0s efficiencies

jetConeEfficiency_Regit.C: 

   Run on the Ntuple:"RegitPYTHIA80_JUNE24_ppCuts_2014.root" and in this Ntuple, 
   the HI Regit tracking was using the pp pT threshold cuts; 
   The Jet that is using here is PFJet, and the jet pT > 60 and |eta| < 2.0; Cone size is 0.3
